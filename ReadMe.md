# 🎲 Star Citizen Event Library

Welcome to the **Event Library** — a collection of custom community-driven events designed for use in the **Star Citizen Persistent Universe (PU)** and game modes like **Star Marine**.

These events add variety, challenge, and roleplay opportunities beyond standard missions, giving orgs and communities structured scenarios to enjoy.

## 📖 What Are Events?
Events are **structured scenarios** with clear rules, objectives, and win conditions. They can range from FPS combat to ship battles, races, or creative roleplay challenges.

Each event is written in a **standard format** so organizers can easily set them up and players can quickly understand how they work.

---

## 🛠️ How Are Events Run?
1. **Pick an Event** from the [Events/](./Events) folder.
2. **Read the Rules** — every event file includes objectives, roles, win conditions, and optional notes.
3. **Organize Players** — assign teams/roles, make sure everyone understands their limitations (weapons, ships, respawns, etc.).
4. **Run the Event** — referees or organizers may be needed for balance and oversight.
5. **Declare a Winner** — based on the event’s win conditions.

Events can be run casually (pick-up games) or formally (scheduled community nights).
