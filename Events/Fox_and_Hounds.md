## ⚔️ Gameplay Example
- **Setup:**
    - One player is chosen as the Fox.
    - Remaining players form the Hound team.
- **Flow:**
    - The Fox starts with a short head start to move/hide.
    - The Hounds coordinate to hunt and corner the Fox using their ships and weapons.
    - Combat may occur in space or on planetary surfaces, depending on where the Fox runs.
- **End Condition:**
    - Once the Fox is killed, the round ends.
    - If the Fox survives for a pre-set time limit (e.g., 15–20 minutes), the Fox wins.

## 🏆 Win Conditions
- **Fox Victory:** Fox survives the time limit or eliminates all Hounds.
- **Hounds Victory:** Fox is killed.

## 🔑 Notes & Tips
- Consider rotating the role of the Fox each round so multiple players get a chance.
- Limiting Hound armor to **medium only** ensures balance against the Fox’s flexibility.
- Organizers should set clear play zones to prevent the Fox from hiding indefinitely.
- Works well as a quick, repeatable “mini-event” between larger ops.
