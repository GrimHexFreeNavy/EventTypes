## ⚔️ Gameplay Example

    - 3 hidden items (data cores, alien relics, contraband, etc.) scattered across the zone.
    - Each round begins with a riddle clue pointing to the item’s location.
    - First team to solve the clue and secure the item must extract it to their base/drop ship.
- **Flow:**
    - Teams race to the target location.
    - Combat may occur during retrieval or extraction.
    - Item must be physically carried (limited weapon usage while carrying).
- **End Condition:**
    - Game ends after 3 rounds or when one team secures the majority (2 of 3 items).

- **Round Victory:** A team secures an item and extracts it successfully.
- **Tiebreaker (if needed):** Final sudden-death item is spawned (decided by new riddle).

## 🔑 Notes & Tips
- Consider using **FPS missions sites** like underground bunkers, derelict ships, or abandoned outposts.
- To keep balance, limit heavy armor or restrict ships to troop transports only.
- Carrying an item should slow the player down or limit weapon usage for tension.
- Riddles can be written ahead of time by the event organizer or randomized from a pool.
