# 🏁 Rally / Relay Racing

**Type:** PvP / Racing Event
**Location:** Planetary surface (recommended: Daymar, MicroTech, or Hurston for varied terrain)
**Frequency:** Custom / Org-run

---

## 🎯 Objective
Teams compete in a **relay-style rally race** across planetary terrain. The **Driver** must reach a hidden **Target** location, but can only get there by following directions relayed from their **Navigator** — who is in a party with the Target and feeds location data.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles & Rules

### Driver
- **Vehicle:** Ground vehicles only (Cyclone, Ursa, ROC-DS, etc.)
- **Weapons & Armor:** Optional, but combat discouraged for clean racing
- **Respawns:** None (wreck = out of the round)

### Navigator
- **Position:** In a party with the Target (In the passenger seat)
- **Role:** Provides directions to their Driver over comms
- **Limitations:** Cannot provide exact marker locations; must guide by description and distance only

### Target
- **Position:** Randomized location within the play zone
- **Role:** Stationary point used as the destination goal for each rally leg
- **Setup:** Should remain in place until all Drivers have reached or failed

---

## ⚔️ Gameplay Example
- **Setup:**
  - Each team has 1 Driver + 1 Navigator.
  - A neutral organizer or system designates the Target’s position.
  - Navigators join the Target’s party to see their marker.
- **Flow:**
  - Drivers start from a common starting line.
  - Navigators guide Drivers toward the Target using verbal directions.
  - First Driver to reach the Target scores the point for their team.
- **Relay Option:**
  - Once the first Target is reached, a new Target location is set.
  - Drivers continue from current positions, with Navigators relaying new directions.
- **End Condition:**
  - Race ends after all Targets have been reached or a set number of rounds completed.

---

## 🏆 Win Conditions
- **Rally Format:** First team to reach the Target wins the leg. Best of X legs determines overall winner.
- **Relay Format:** Team with the fastest overall time after all legs completed.

## 🔑 Notes & Tips
- Use **party markers** for navigators only — prevents unfair advantage for drivers.
- Race organizers may set “terrain rules” (no highways, no water shortcuts, must remain within visual ground contact).
- Night races add difficulty (rely on headlights + navigator accuracy).
- Consider optional **vehicle class restrictions** (light vehicles only, heavy only, mixed-class relay).
